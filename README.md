# Video Game Discovery App

## Overview

Video game discovery app is a minimal clone of the RAWG website. We said minimal because we have some basic features that satisfy learning purposes, so obviously we missed some main features like authentication, dynamic preview, etc. With all that this app has some basic features that listed below:

- Show the games, platforms and critic score
- Show the genres with selection feature
- Sort the games based on their platforms and other related options like name, score, etc
- Search the games based on their names

## My process

### Built with

- React
- TypeScript
- Chakra UI

### What I learned

In this challenge I tried to focus on main functions and features with pure React. So I learned common patterns like fetching data, selection, sorting, searching, etc. Also the other part was related to TypeScript. Currently I'm learning React with TypeScript and this challenge covers important topics of both. On the other hand, Chakra UI was my first experience, so I learned a lot about it.

### Continued development

Like I said before, authentication and more stuff was missing in this version, so we can open a space for these features. But more important than these features, the way we covered current details is our next goal. Adding two or three technologies like React Query, React Router, and lightweight state manager like Zustand are very helpful for this app.

## Acknowledgments

The challenge and original idea is related to Mosh Hamedani's new React 18 course. I review the concepts several times, after that try the challenge individually. But in some parts, I encounter problems, so check the solutions and in final review, update the whole challenge with the necessary lines.
