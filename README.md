## My process

### Built with

- React
- TypeScript
- Chakra UI

### What I learned

In this challenge I tried to focus on main functions and features with pure React. So I learned common patterns like fetching data, selection, sorting, searching, etc. Also the other part was related to TypeScript. Currently I'm learning React with TypeScript and this project covers important topics of both.

### Continued development

This is the first version of this app with just React. I'll create another version soon that has more features like new methods for data fetching with catching option, state management, routing and overall improvement for the whole app.

## Acknowledgments

This challenge is part of the Mosh Hamedaniâ€™s React course and I tried it myself after reviewing the course materials. Like other repositories, this is an important reference for the future.
